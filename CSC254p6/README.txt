For this assignment my task is to implement variants on a set collection type.  These should look familiar given our discussion of the dictionary (mapping) types used by switch (case) statements. 

To run the code I use the following command
/home/hoover/u5/span9/CSC254A6$ g++ -o source Source1.h test.cpp
/home/hoover/u5/span9/CSC254A6$ ./source

Sample output for my own examples and sample examples, the examples are in the test.cpp  file
