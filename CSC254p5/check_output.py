'''
Script to check output of dining philosophers.
Must give a file with lines of the format:
Philosopher <n> <state>
where <n> is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} and <state> is {thinking, waiting, eating}

Program will check to make sure no two adjacent philosophers are eating
at the same time and output a showing the proportion of time each
philosopher spent in each state.
